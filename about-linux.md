# [History](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/linux-history)

Unix was developed in 1669. It was rewritten in C so it could be ported(become more widely used) more easily
Richard Stallman started working on GNU (Unix like free operating system) Kernal called  HURD which never complete but did leave a free software license to use. The  Linux Kernal (allows the hardware to talk to the software) was developed by Linus Torvalds 

GNU is the operating system and Linux is a kernal. GNU is most often used with the linux kernal in a package called a distribution. People often call the operating system linux by mistake. Linux is Unix-like but not a direct decendant
